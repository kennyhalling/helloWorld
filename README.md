# Overview

{This software creates a simple Python function that takes someone's name and then greets them from the terminal with a "Hello" statement.}

{I created this software to practice my Python skills and to demonstrate how to create a simple function that interacts with the user.}

# Development Environment

{To create this software, I used Python 3.12.10 on a Windows 11 machine. The code editor I used was Visual Studio Code.}

{I used the Python language to write this function, because it is an easy language for beginners to learn. This way those who see this code can get a grasp on how a function-based program works.}
